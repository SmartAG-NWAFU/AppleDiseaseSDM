# AppleDiseaseSDM
## Overview
**AppleDiseaseSDM** This study investigates the environmental suitability of three major apple diseases in China—Apple Valsa Canker (AVC), Apple Ring Rot (ARR), and Alternaria Blotch on Apple (ABA)​—using ​five species distribution models (SDMs)​: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Random Forest (RF).

This project is based on the study:
> "Spatially-explicitly predicting suitability of three apple diseases in China: a comparative analysis of five species distribution models."

## Features
- **​Data & Methods:** Analyzed ​1,392 georeferenced disease occurrence records​ across China’s apple-growing regions.
- **Model Performance:** Evaluated using ​AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)​​ and ​TSS (True Skill Statistics)​..
- **​High-Risk Regions:** Bohai Bay, Loess Plateau, and Old Course of the Yellow River were identified as ​highly suitable​ for disease outbreaks
