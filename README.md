This study investigates the environmental suitability of three major apple diseases in China—Apple Valsa Canker (AVC), Apple Ring Rot (ARR), and Alternaria Blotch on Apple (ABA)​—using ​five species distribution models (SDMs)​: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), and Random Forest (RF).

​Key Features:​​
​Data & Methods:​​ Analyzed ​1,392 georeferenced disease occurrence records​ across China’s apple-growing regions.
​Model Performance:​​ Evaluated using ​AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)​​ and ​TSS (True Skill Statistics)​.
​Top Performers:​​ MaxEnt and RF achieved ​AUC > 0.95​ and ​TSS > 0.78​ for all three diseases.
​Moderate Performers:​​ SVM, GLM, and GAM showed ​AUC (0.88–0.92)​​ and ​TSS (0.69–0.72)​.
​High-Risk Regions:​​ Bohai Bay, Loess Plateau, and Old Course of the Yellow River were identified as ​highly suitable​ for disease outbreaks.
​Key Drivers:​​
​Mean temperature of the driest quarter​
​Annual maximum temperature​
(Critical for spore germination, host colonization, and pathogen development.)
​Impact & Applications:​​
​Targeted Disease Management:​​ Helps prioritize high-risk zones for surveillance and control.
​Early Warning Systems:​​ Supports proactive measures under ​climate change.
​Ecological Insights:​​ Links pathogen biology with environmental predictors to improve model accuracy.
This repository provides ​code, data, and analysis workflows​ for replicating the study or adapting the framework to other plant diseases. Contributions and collaborations are welcome!
